I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

##Comments

This was a great step to take in the process of completing the actual website. I have always found mockups to be slightly annoying, because I always seem to change elements as I code. I think using the Style Tile and Style Prototype in the future will be much more effective, as they assume you do not have the design fully hashed out, but give you a great starting point that both allows change and solidifies certain elements.

It was also very helpful to do another responsive webpage before completing the final website.
